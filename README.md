## BINARY TREES

### Introduction

#### What is a Binary Tree?
A binary tree(BT) or rooted binary tree is a data structure which utilizes linked
lists or arrays. It can thus be simply defined as a node in memory connected
to at most 2 other nodes (a left node and a right node).

#### What is the Repo all about?
This repo contains various operations including the creation, modification and
manipulatibg binary trees inorder to better understand the implications of
utilizing BTs in a project.



### Contents

0: creates a binary tree node.

1: inserts a node as the left-child of another node.

2: inserts a node as the right-child of another node.

3: deletes an entire binary tree.

4: checks if a node is a leaf.

5: checks if a given node is a root.

6: goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal.

7: goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal.

8: goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal.

9: measures the height of a binary tree.

10: measures the depth of a node in a binary tree.

11: measures the size of a binary tree.

12: counts the leaves in a binary tree.

13: counts the nodes with at least 1 child in a binary tree.

14: measures the balance factor of a binary tree.

15: checks if a binary tree is full.

16: checks if a binary tree is perfect.

17: finds the sibling of a node.

18: finds the uncle of a node.
